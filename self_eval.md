# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?

*I feel pretty confident in understanding and fluency with the comparison operators.*

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?

*I also feel good about the logical operators! Determining where to use "and" versus "or" in a program is a little tricky but so far with simple use cases it makes sense to me.*

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?

*I generally feel good about if statements, so far. The guidance to go from specific to general is really helpful. I am anticipating more trouble ahead when the conditions aren't so simple and straightforward and could see it getting sticky to write logic that covers all possible conditions with multiple variables.*

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?

*I spent about an hour during our live session, and then another two hours or so practicing and completing the assignment. This is a little bit more time than I anticipated - I did not properly look ahead to the full directions for the Check for Understanding and it ended up being a bit longer to complete than I thought it would be, with more parts.*

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

*I still need to practice keyboard shortcuts for working with multiple programs and getting comfortable navigating files and programs without my mouse. I will build this into my ongoing practice with future assignments in this segment and beyond, so don't really need to adjust the calendar.*

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

*No specific questions about the Conditionals lesson at the moment! Stay tuned.*
